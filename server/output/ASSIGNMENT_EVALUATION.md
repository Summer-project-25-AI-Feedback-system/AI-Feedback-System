Here is the evaluation based on the criteria:

1. Syntax and Validity (8/10):
   - The code appears to be syntactically correct, but without running the code, it's challenging to confirm if it compiles without errors.

2. Structure and Organization (18/20):
   - The directory structure is well-organized, with components, pages, context, and services logically separated.
   - Proper separation of concerns is maintained with components and services in their respective directories.

3. Clarity and Readability (18/20):
   - Variable and function names are descriptive, making the code easy to read and understand.
   - The file structure and naming conventions are consistent, contributing to overall clarity.

4. Language-specific features (18/20):
   - The code utilizes language-specific features like React Router, context API, and TypeScript effectively.
   - TypeScript is used for type safety, enhancing code quality.

5. Best practices (28/30):
   - The code follows best practices by separating concerns, using context for state management, and employing TypeScript for type checking.
   - Error handling and code duplication seem to be appropriately addressed.

Total Rating: 4.2/5

Overall, the codebase demonstrates a strong understanding of best practices and language features. To further improve, consider adding comments for complex logic, ensuring consistent coding style across files, and implementing error handling where necessary. Keep up the good work!

Here's my concise review of the code:

Rating: 4/5

Strengths:
1. Well-organized component structure with clear separation of concerns
2. Good use of TypeScript for type safety throughout the codebase
3. Effective use of React hooks and context API for state management

Improvements:
1. Some components could benefit from more detailed prop documentation
2. Error handling could be more consistent across API calls
3. Some mock data could be moved to dedicated test files

Score: 63/70

Key breakdown:
- Syntax: 10/10 (Clean, error-free code)
- Structure: 14/15 (Well-organized but some components could be split further)
- Readability: 18/20 (Good but some complex components need more comments)
- Language: 9/10 (Good TypeScript usage)
- Best Practices: 12/15 (Follows most React best practices)Here's my concise feedback on the code:

Rating: 4/5

Strengths:
1. Well-organized component structure with clear separation of concerns
